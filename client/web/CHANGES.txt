CHANGES
    
    *new folder
        vendors: folder for vendor libraries which span multiple filetypes, css, js..
    
    *new class structure
        I tried to seutp a generic class structure for advanced use, 
        let me know what you think about it
        
        class
            GameModel:model
            $Element:elm
                a fixed element which the parentview should inject into its elm.
                
            method:constructor:<name of the class>
            
            method:render
                updates the content of this.elm
                
            method:notify
                notify the instance that it's model has changed
                
            method:_<> 
                signifies a pseudo private method
                which should be of no interest outside the class
                maybe there are far better ways to do this?
    
    *new classes
        playerinturn_view:
            sort-of-a controller right now, it's a little hack...
            includes the 'overridePlayerInTurn' method added to the model as a quickfix
            
        selection_view:
            a modal view which supports single-card selection by image 
            
        options_view:
            display playerInTurn's current options, and 
            delegate option select to the matching controller,
            and the selection_view respectively for execution and choice request.
            
            only support character select right now.
            
    *updated main.js
        to include new views, 
        also pushed model to global view to ease development
        
    *todo:  
        should probably refactor and extract generic view to superclass
        same goes for option select, maybe..
        
        EXPERIMENT WITH PRIVATE NAMESPACE BY VARIABLES INSTEAD OF THIS..
