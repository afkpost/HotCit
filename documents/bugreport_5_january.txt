todo: include simulate path to replicate bugs

bug> takeGold does not cause updated model (suspect serverproblem)

solved bug> when draw district, new cards are not included in buildDistrict option
	Server only returns district that the player can afford
	
bug> character ability is not reset, when reseting game
	

-- bug> charcter points are not updated, i.e. districts does not yield points..

solved bug> warlord's ability does not cost gold
	is free for districts of value 1

bug> server sends server-error sometimes, when the effect and message is correct.


refactor suggestion> magician's use of ability is annoying and unintuitive,
                     it would fit the general approach if the option allowed
                     direct return of either cards, or player.
                     (can't remember one of the two requires three option selections),
                     
refactor> it would be nice with a prober state update print from server,
          when debugging it is not clear what the server actually recieves.
          Will be implement in another langueue
