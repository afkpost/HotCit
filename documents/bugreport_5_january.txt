todo: include simulate path to replicate bugs
bug> takeGold does not cause updated model (suspect serverproblem)
bug> when draw district, new cards are not included in buildDistrict option
bug> character ability is not reset, when resting game
bug> gold points are not updated every time an ability is used
bug> warlord's ability does not cost gold
bug> server sends server-error sometimes, when the effect and message is correct.
refactor suggestion> magician's use of ability is annoying and unintuitive,
                     it would fit the general approach if the option allowed
                     direct return of either cards, or player.
                     (can't remember one of the two requires three option selections),
                     
refactor> it would be nice with a prober state update print from server,
          when debugging it is not clear what the server actually recieves.
